# adventofcode2021
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent Of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) challenges.

Most of the solutions are using Python - I'd like to make equivalent solutions in golang when I have the time.

Please feel free to message me if you have any critiques relating to my code - I'm always looking to improve.
